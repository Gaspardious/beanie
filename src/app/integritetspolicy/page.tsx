        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4 pt-10'>Since May 25, 2018, the Personal Data Act (PUL) has been replaced by the new Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The purpose of PUL has been to protect people against their personal integrity being violated when their personal data is processed. GDPR sets higher requirements for how we as an organization process your personal data and gives you better opportunities to influence our handling.
        <br /> <br />
        In the policy, we describe why we process your personal data, which personal data we process, which legal basis we support the processing on and how long the data is stored. We also describe how you can influence the processing by exercising your rights. We also give you information where you can turn to if you are not satisfied with our handling. It is important that you take part of and understand the privacy policy. You are always welcome to contact us if you have any questions.

        <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold'>What the change means for you</h2>
        In short, GDPR means that… <br /> <br />

        …you have the right to receive more detailed information about how we process your personal data. We give you such information in the privacy policy below, <br /> <br />

        …you have the opportunity to, under certain conditions, request that your personal data is moved or that we limit the processing, <br /> <br />

        …that you have strengthened opportunities to take part in your personal data and that, under certain conditions, get them corrected or deleted, <br /> <br />

        …that you can approve or object to certain processing that we perform, for example for sending information such as newsletters via email.

        </p>


        <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>1. Information about personal data</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> In this privacy policy, we are called Gaspar Invest AB and are the data controller. Personal data is information that can directly or indirectly identify you, such as your name, phone number, and email address.</p>
       
       <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>2. Processing of personal data</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> Everything we do with your personal data is considered processing. This applies regardless of whether we use automated systems or not. We process your personal data in connection with sending information, payments, handling complaints, to comply with applicable legislation such as the Accounting Act, to send newsletters, etc.
        </p>

       <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>3. Personal data handled</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> The personal data we collect about you consists of customer data. These are information such as name, email address, phone number, address information, and other information provided by you.
        </p>

       <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>4. What the data is used for</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> In order for us to be able to process your personal data, we must have specified an explicit and legitimate purpose for the processing. The personal data must then not be processed in a way that is incompatible with the original purpose. In addition, we must have support in law, so-called legal basis, in order to be able to process personal data.  <br /> <br />
        The processing of personal data that we perform, we support on the following legal grounds and consent:  <br /> <br />

        a Processing of your personal data is necessary in order to enter into or fulfill the agreement with you.  <br /> <br />

        b The processing of your personal data is necessary in order for us to be able to fulfill a legal obligation, for example to save personal data for accounting purposes.  <br /> <br />

        c We evaluate, after a so-called interest balancing, that our interests in processing your personal data weigh more than your right to privacy protection.  <br /> <br />

        In order for us to be able to fulfill the agreement with you, we need to process and handle your personal data. Below are examples of for which purposes we process your personal data and with which legal basis we do this.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>Providing services</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> We process your personal data to the extent necessary for us to be able to identify you as a customer. We also need to process your personal data in order to be able to debit you according to the agreement as well as to be able to take collection actions if this is necessary to ensure that our claim is paid.  <br /> <br />
        <em>Legal basis of the above according to the following: Fulfillment of the agreement according to point 1 and Legitimate interest according to point 3. Our legitimate interest for the processing in this part is that we ensure payment according to the agreement with you.</em>
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>Other communication about services</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> We process personal data in connection with other communication with you, for example to provide you with information. This can, for example, take the form of newsletters sent via email. We also process personal data that we receive from you when and if you have chosen to respond to customer surveys that we have sent to you or that you have taken part in in another way.   <br /> <br />
        <em>Legal basis of the above according to the following: Fulfillment of the agreement according to point 1 and Legitimate interest according to point 3. Our legitimate interests for the processing of personal data in customer surveys are that we want to get your opinions in order to improve our offer based on it.</em>
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>Compliance with laws</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> We process your personal data in order to be able to fulfill the statutory duties that we are obliged to, for example the requirement of the Accounting Act to store accounting material.  <br /> <br />
        <em>Legal basis of the above according to the following: Legal obligation according to point 2.</em>
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>5. How we collect the data</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> We collect personal data in connection with you registering on the website, contacting your financial manager, phone or by personal visit to us.
        </p>


        <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>6. How long the data is stored</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> We do not store personal data about you longer than we need based on the purpose we process them for. We therefore never store personal data just because they are ”good to have”, but always have a defined purpose that has support in legislation or in an agreement. <br /> <br />
        Since the data we collect is processed for different purposes, it is also stored for different periods of time. It may therefore be the case that personal data about you is stored in one system, but deleted in another.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>7. To whom the data is disclosed</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> In some situations we share your personal data with others. Below we describe when and why we do this. We want to emphasize that we never disclose your personal data unless it is required for us to be able to perform any of the processing that is mentioned above, which we have a purpose and for which there is a legal basis. We also do not sell your personal data to others. <br /> <br />
         <strong>Suppliers and other personal data processors for our account</strong>  <br /> <br />
          We hire different suppliers in order for us to be able to provide our services. When we use suppliers that process personal data for our account, we regulate in an agreement that the supplier (personal data processor) may only process personal data for purposes that we determine and on specific instructions from us. Our suppliers are therefore not allowed to do anything with your personal data that we have not explicitly told them to do. We also set requirements for the supplier&apos;s handling of personal data to be secure and correct.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>8. Your rights</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'> 
        You have the right to receive information about how we process your personal data. Such information you get in this policy. If you have any further questions about our processing of personal data, you are welcome to contact us. Contact information can be found at the bottom of the policy. <br /> <br />

        In addition to the right to information, you also have other rights in relation to your personal data. You can, for example, influence our processing by requesting extracts, corrections, deletions and restrictions. You also have the right to object to certain processing that we perform as well as to request your personal data or request that they be moved. <br /> <br />

        Your right to be deleted presupposes that the data is no longer needed for the purpose for which they were collected, if the processing is based on an interest balancing and there are no legitimate reasons that weigh more than your interest, if the personal data has been processed illegally, or if you object to processing for direct marketing purposes. The right to be deleted does not apply if we are obliged by law (e.g. the Accounting Act) to keep the data. <br /> <br />

        You have the right to request an extract, correction, deletion and/or restriction of the personal data we process about you. Since it is important that we do not leave your personal data to anyone else, such a request must be made in writing and signed by you. Specify what the request is about. Send the request in a letter to us where you indicate your name and personal number, your address and a copy of a valid ID document signed by you. <br /> <br />

        The extract will be sent to you within 30 days from the time we received the request. If the extract is extensive so that we need more time or if we for any reason cannot carry out your request, we will inform you of this. <br /> <br />

        Please send your request to us: Ahrenbergsvägen 4C, 416 73 Göteborg.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-black font-bold w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>9. Security</h2>
        <p className='text-black w-3/4 sm:text-lg sm:w-2/4'>We protect your personal data through a combination of technical and organizational solutions. Access systems are required to access all of our systems that handle personal data. Employees at us as well as personal data processors and sub-processors must follow our internal information security policy.
        </p>
